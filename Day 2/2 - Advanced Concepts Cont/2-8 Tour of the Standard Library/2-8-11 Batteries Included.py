### 2-8-11 Batteries Included ###
# Python has a “batteries included” philosophy. This is best seen through the sophisticated and robust
# capabilities of its larger packages. For example:

# The xmlrpclib and SimpleXMLRPCServer modules make implementing remote procedure calls into an almost
# trivial task. Despite the modules names, no direct knowledge or handling of XML is needed.

# The email package is a library for managing email messages, including MIME and other RFC 2822-based
# message documents. Unlike smtplib and poplib which actually send and receive messages, the email
# package has a complete toolset for building or decoding complex message structures (including
# attachments) and for implementing internet encoding and header protocols.

# The xml.dom and xml.sax packages provide robust support for parsing this popular data interchange
# format. Likewise, the csv module supports direct reads and writes in a common database format.
# Together, these modules and packages greatly simplify data interchange between Python applications
# and other tools.

# Internationalization is supported by a number of modules including gettext, locale, and the codecs
# package.
